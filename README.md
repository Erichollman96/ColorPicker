# Tkinter Color Picker Palette

An interactive **Python/Tkinter color picker** inspired by tools like [htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).  
This app lets you select colors using a **hue slider** and **saturation/value square**, preview them in real-time, save with notes, manage a history of chosen colors, and export your palette to a text file.
